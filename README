dnspython

INTRODUCTION

dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates.  It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set.  The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.

To see a few of the ways dnspython can be used, look in the examples/
directory.

dnspython originated at Nominum where it was developed to facilitate
the testing of DNS software.  Nominum has generously allowed it to be
open sourced under a BSD-style license, and helps support its future
development by continuing to employ the author :).


ABOUT THIS RELEASE

This is dnspython 1.3.3.

New since 1.3.2:

    	dns.message.Message.find_rrset() now uses an index, vastly
	improving the from_wire() performance of large messages such
	as zone transfers.

	Added dns.message.make_response(), which creates a skeletal
	response for the specified query.

	Added opcode() and set_opcode() convenience methods to the
	dns.message.Message class.  Added the request_payload
	attribute to the Message class.

        The 'file' parameter of dns.name.Name.to_wire() is now
	optional; if omitted, the wire form will be returned as the
	value of the function.

	dns.zone.from_xfr() in relativization mode incorrectly set
	zone.origin to the empty name.

	The masterfile parser incorrectly rejected TXT records where a
	value was not quoted.

New since 1.3.1:

	The NSEC format doesn't allow specifying types by number, so
	we shouldn't either.  (Using the unknown type format is still
	OK though.)

	The resolver wasn't catching dns.exception.Timeout, so a timeout
	erroneously caused the whole resolution to fail instead of just
	going on to the next server.

	The renderer module didn't import random, causing an exception
	to be raised if a query id wasn't provided when a Renderer was
	created.

        The conversion of LOC milliseconds values from text to binary was
	incorrect if the length of the milliseconds string was not 3.

New since 1.3.0:

	Added support for the SSHFP type.

New since 1.2.0:

	Added support for new DNSSEC types RRSIG, NSEC, and DNSKEY.

This release fixes all known bugs.

See the ChangeLog file for more detailed information on changes since
the prior release.
